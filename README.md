# BLACKJACK assignment

This repository serves as home for my first Sinatra web app - Blackjack.
The assignment is done for Tealeaf Academy - course 1 - week 3.


## How to start?
1. Make sure the 'sinatra' gem is installed. (gem install sinatra)
2. Clone the repo to your machine!
2. From the command line, you can start the server by 'ruby main.rb'
3. If you have the 'shotgun' gem installed, you can instead run 'shotgun main.rb'
4. Ctrl+c to stop the server
